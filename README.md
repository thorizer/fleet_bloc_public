# gdm_bloc

nothing much going on lib besides the asset feature (in asset_bloc you'll find _onRealtimeAssetSubscriptionRequested event who's responsible for the lag )

the socket_api is inside the ngi_repository package 

there is multiple void main functions that are hidden from file export ( for testing purposes)
