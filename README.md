# Fleet Management App That uses Bloc pattern 
the app currently have unresolved performance issues

## Intro 🚙
Currently my app shows a list of assets (cars) loaded at the start, 
the assets are updated in Realtime from socket.io. 


every time a message comes from the socket, an asset's Realtime properties will be updated.
(The assets list will remain constant after the first load)

## Performance 📈
In desktop and browser, there is no lag or performance issue. Meanwhile on mobile, I can't even open the drawer. The app is not usable even if I remove all widgets from the tree.
My app currently reaches 1 fps on mobile (profile mode) while the stream is on, and very smooth when it's off. The frequency of updates could reach 10 assets per second. 
I don't have any widgets that rebuild unnecessarily, the UI thread is not the issue

Returning a realtimeData map every time a state changes with socket.io is not very optimal.
Without state management? I would just do this `realtimeData[asset.id] = asset.realtimeData;`

Could this be a limitation of state.copyWith when used with non-primitive values?

**In summary:** Listening to the stream itself is not expensive, changing the state 10 times a second and overwriting the Realtime map object each time is
 
## Possible solutions: 🗝️
- Saving the socket data in a temporary map and then update the state after a while in a batch. doable ? 
- finding a way to update a single asset without recreating the whole map with a spread operator. doable ? 
- throttle the stream. doable ? 
- using spread operator instead of map.of when emmiting a new state had a slightly better performance ✔
- removing unnecessarily rebuilds didn't help, even SizedBox.shrink as child of scaffold whith 0 rebuilds ❌
- splitiing the asset bloc features into asset and realtime will not help (I commented all the class members and kept the realtime object, I didn't update it with data coming from the socket, just spreading the object and give it back to the state , and the issue persisted ) ❌


## Project 🚧
**Feel free to ask for credentials if you want to test.**

The state in my block looks like the code below, the map contains the asset Id and it's corresponding Realtime data

    final List<Asset> assets;
    final Map<String, Rt?> realtimeData;
the event which subscribes to the stream looks like this:

    Future<void> _onRealtimeAssetSubscriptionRequested(
        RealtimeAssetSubscriptionRequested event,
        Emitter<AssetState> emit,
      ) async {
        await SocketApi.init();
        await emit.forEach<Asset>(
          SocketApi.getAsset(),
          onData: (asset) {
            return state.copyWith(socketStatus: SocketStatus.success, 
             realtimeData: {
              ...state.realtimeData,
              asset.id: RtRepo(
                consL_Km: asset.realtimeData?.consL_Km,
                gps_dt: asset.realtimeData?.gps_dt,
                io_dt: asset.realtimeData?.io_dt,
                last_stop_dt: asset.realtimeData?.last_stop_dt,
                odo: asset.realtimeData?.odo,
                working_time: asset.realtimeData?.working_time,
                loc: asset.realtimeData?.loc,
                loc_dt: asset.realtimeData?.loc_dt,
                io: asset.realtimeData?.io,
              ),
            });
          },
          onError: (_, __) => state.copyWith(
            socketStatus: SocketStatus.failure,
          ),
        );
      }


- nothing much going on lib besides the asset feature (in asset_bloc you'll find _onRealtimeAssetSubscriptionRequested event who's responsible for the lag)

- the socket_api is inside the ngi_repository package
